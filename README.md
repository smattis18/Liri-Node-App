# Node LIRI Bot

### Overview

This is a node app called LIRI (Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface) that you can use to look up concert dates, song information and/or movie information.  You can also add this information to a text file (in the correct format of course) and have LIRI read it to provide the information you are looking for.

### Instructions

1. Open up a terminal and use node.js to run the liri.js file
2. Use one of the following commands to look-up information <'command' 'value'>:
    * '**concert-this**' --> To utilize the Bands In Town API to look-up concert information
    * '**spotify-this-song**' --> To utilize the Spotify node package to look-up song information
    * '**movie-this**' --> To utilize the OMDB API to look-up movie information
    * '**do-what-it-says**' --> To read concert, song or movie instructions from the random.txt file; use the following format: spotify-this-song,"I Want it That Way"
